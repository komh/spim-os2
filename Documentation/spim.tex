\section{SPIM}

SPIM S20 is a simulator that runs programs for the MIPS R2000/R3000 RISC
computers.\footnote{For a description of the real machines, see Gerry Kane
and Joe Heinrich, {\em MIPS RISC Architecture,\/} Prentice Hall, 1992.} SPIM
can read and immediately execute files containing assembly language.  SPIM
is a self-contained system for running these programs and contains a
debugger and interface to a few operating system services.

The architecture of the MIPS computers is simple and regular, which
makes it easy to learn and understand.  The processor contains 32
general-purpose 32-bit registers and a well-designed instruction set that
make it a propitious target for generating code in a compiler.

However, the obvious question is: why use a simulator when many people
have workstations that contain a hardware, and hence significantly
faster, implementation of this computer?  One reason is that these
workstations are not generally available.  Another reason is that
these machine will not persist for many years because of the rapid
progress leading to new and faster computers.  Unfortunately, the
trend is to make computers faster by executing several instructions
concurrently, which makes their architecture more difficult to
understand and program.  The MIPS architecture may be the epitome of a
simple, clean RISC machine.

In addition, simulators can provide a better environment for low-level
programming than an actual machine because they can detect more errors
and provide more features than an actual computer.  For example, SPIM
has a X-window interface that is better than most debuggers for the
actual machines.

Finally, simulators are an useful tool for studying computers and the
programs that run on them.  Because they are implemented in software,
not silicon, they can be easily modified to add new instructions,
build new systems such as multiprocessors, or simply to collect data.

\subsection{Simulation of a Virtual Machine}

The MIPS architecture, like that of most RISC computers, is difficult
to program directly because of its delayed branches, delayed loads,
and restricted address modes.  This difficulty is tolerable since
these computers were designed to be programmed in high-level languages
and so present an interface designed for compilers, not programmers.
A good part of the complexity results from delayed instructions.  A
{\em delayed branch\/} takes two cycles to execute.  In the second
cycle, the instruction immediately following the branch executes.
This instruction can perform useful work that normally would have been
done before the branch or it can be a {\tt nop} (no operation).
Similarly, {\em delayed loads\/} take two cycles so the instruction
immediately following a load cannot use the value loaded from memory.

MIPS wisely choose to hide this complexity by implementing a {\em
virtual machine\/} with their assembler.  This virtual computer
appears to have non-delayed branches and loads and a richer
instruction set than the actual hardware.  The assembler {\em
reorganizes\/} (rearranges) instructions to fill the delay slots.  It
also simulates the additional, {\em pseudoinstructions\/} by
generating short sequences of actual instructions.

By default, SPIM simulates the richer, virtual machine.  It can also
simulate the actual hardware.  We will describe the virtual machine
and only mention in passing features that do not belong to the actual
hardware.  In doing so, we are following the convention of MIPS
assembly language programmers (and compilers), who routinely take
advantage of the extended machine.  Instructions marked with a dagger
($\dagger$) are pseudoinstructions.

\subsection{SPIM Interface}

SPIM provides a simple terminal and a X-window interface.  Both
provide equivalent functionality, but the X interface is generally
easier to use and more informative.

{\tt spim}, the terminal version, and {\tt xspim}, the X version, have
the following command-line options:
\begin{description}
  \item [] {\tt -bare}\newline Simulate a bare MIPS machine without
pseudoinstructions or the additional addressing modes provided by the
assembler.  Implies {\tt -quiet}.

  \item [] {\tt -asm}\newline Simulate the virtual MIPS machine
provided by the assembler.  This is the default.

  \item [] {\tt -pseudo} \newline Accept pseudoinstructions in assembly
code. 

  \item [] {\tt -nopseudo} \newline Do not accept pseudoinstructions in
assembly code. 

  \item [] {\tt -notrap} \newline Do not load the standard trap
handler.  This trap handler has two functions that must be assumed by
the user's program.  First, it handles traps.  When a trap occurs,
SPIM jumps to location 0x80000080, which should contain code to
service the exception.  Second, this file contains startup code that
invokes the routine {\tt main}.  Without the trap handler, execution
begins at the instruction labeled {\tt \_\_start}.

  \item [] {\tt -trap}\newline Load the standard trap handler.  This
is the default.

  \item [] {\tt -trap\_file}\newline Load the trap handler in the file.

  \item [] {\tt -noquiet}\newline Print a message when an exception
occurs.  This is the default.

  \item [] {\tt -quiet}\newline Do not print a message at an
exception.

  \item [] {\tt -nomapped\_io}\newline Disable the memory-mapped IO
facility (see Section~\ref{sec:IO}).

  \item [] {\tt -mapped\_io}\newline Enable the memory-mapped IO facility
(see Section~\ref{sec:IO}).  Programs that use SPIM syscalls (see
Section~\ref{sec:scall}) to read from the terminal should not also use
memory-mapped IO.

  \item [] {\tt -file}\newline Load and execute the assembly code in
the file.

  \item [] {\tt -s seg size} Sets the initial size of memory segment
{\em seg\/} to be {\em size\/} bytes.  The memory segments are named:
{\tt text}, {\tt data}, {\tt stack}, {\tt ktext}, and {\tt kdata}.
For example, the pair of arguments {\tt -sdata 2000000} starts the
user data segment at 2,000,000 bytes.

  \item [] {\tt -lseg size} Sets the limit on how large memory segment
{\em seg\/} can grow to be {\em size\/} bytes.  The memory segments
that can grow are: {\tt data}, {\tt stack}, and {\tt kdata}.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Terminal Interface}

The terminal interface ({\tt spim}) provides the following commands:
\begin{description}
  \item [] {\tt exit}\newline Exit the simulator.

  \item [] {\tt read "file"}\newline Read {\em file\/} of assembly
language commands into SPIM's memory.  If the file has already been
read into SPIM, the system should be cleared (see {\tt reinitialize},
below) or global symbols will be multiply defined.

  \item [] {\tt load "file"}\newline Synonym for {\tt read}.

  \item [] {\tt run <addr>}\newline Start running a program.  If the
optional address {\em addr\/} is provided, the program starts at that
address.  Otherwise, the program starts at the global symbol {\tt
\_\_start}, which is defined by the default trap handler to call the
routine at the global symbol {\tt main} with the usual MIPS calling
convention.

  \item [] {\tt step <N>}\newline Step the program for {\em N\/}
(default: 1) instructions.  Print instructions as they execute.

  \item [] {\tt continue}\newline Continue program execution without
stepping.

  \item [] {\tt print \$N}\newline Print register {\em N\/}.

  \item [] {\tt print \$fN}\newline Print floating point register {\em
N\/}.

  \item [] {\tt print addr}\newline Print the contents of memory at
address {\em addr\/}.

  \item [] {\tt print\_sym}\newline Print the contents of the symbol
table, i.e., the addresses of the global (but not local) symbols.

  \item [] {\tt reinitialize}\newline Clear the memory and registers.

  \item [] {\tt breakpoint addr}\newline Set a breakpoint at address
{\em addr\/}.  {\em addr\/} can be either a memory address or symbolic
label.

  \item [] {\tt delete addr}\newline Delete all breakpoints at address
{\em addr\/}.

  \item [] {\tt list}\newline List all breakpoints.

  \item [] {\tt .}\newline Rest of line is an assembly instruction
that is stored in memory.

  \item [] {\tt <nl>}\newline A newline reexecutes previous command.

  \item [] {\tt ?}\newline Print a help message.
\end{description}

Most commands can be abbreviated to their unique prefix e.g., {\tt
ex}, {\tt re}, {\tt l}, {\tt ru}, {\tt s}, {\tt p}.  More dangerous
commands, such as {\tt reinitialize}, require a longer prefix.

\subsubsection{X-Window Interface}

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\psfig{figure=xinterface.id,height=4.5in}}
  \caption{X-window interface to SPIM.}
  \label{fig:xinterface}
\end{figure}
The X version of SPIM, {\tt xspim}, looks different, but should
operate in the same manner as {\tt spim}.  The X window has five panes
(see Figure~\ref{fig:xinterface}).  The top pane displays the contents
of the registers.  It is continually updated, except while a program
is running.

The next pane contains the buttons that control the simulator:
\begin{itemize}
  \item [] {\bf quit}\newline Exit from the simulator.

  \item [] {\bf load}\newline Read a source file into memory.

  \item [] {\bf run}\newline Start the program running.

  \item [] {\bf step}\newline Single-step through a program.

  \item [] {\bf clear}\newline Reinitialize registers or memory.

  \item [] {\bf set value}\newline Set the value in a register or
memory location.

  \item [] {\bf print}\newline Print the value in a register or memory
location.

  \item [] {\bf breakpoint}\newline Set or delete a breakpoint or list
all breakpoints.

  \item [] {\bf help}\newline Print a help message.

  \item [] {\bf terminal}\newline Raise or hide the console window.

  \item [] {\bf mode}\newline Set SPIM operating modes.
\end{itemize}

The next two panes display the memory contents.  The top one shows
instructions from the user and kernel text segments.\footnote{These
instructions are real---not pseudo---MIPS instructions.  SPIM
translates assembler pseudoinstructions to 1--3 MIPS instructions
before storing the program in memory.  Each source instruction appears
as a comment on the first instruction to which it is translated.} The
first few instructions in the text segment are startup code ({\tt
\_\_start}) that loads {\tt argc} and {\tt argv} into registers and
invokes the {\tt main} routine.

The lower of these two panes displays the data and stack segments.
Both panes are updated as a program executes.

The bottom pane is used to display messages from the simulator.  It
does not display output from an executing program.  When a program
reads or writes, its IO appears in a separate window, called the
Console, which pops up when needed.

\subsection{Surprising Features}

Although SPIM faithfully simulates the MIPS computer, it is a
simulator and certain things are not identical to the actual computer.
The most obvious differences are that instruction timing and the
memory systems are not identical.  SPIM does not simulate caches or
memory latency, nor does it accurate reflect the delays for floating
point operations or multiplies and divides.

Another surprise (which occurs on the real machine as well) is that a
pseudoinstruction expands into several machine instructions.  When
single-stepping or examining memory, the instructions that you see are
slightly different from the source program.  The correspondence
between the two sets of instructions is fairly simple since SPIM does
not reorganize the instructions to fill delay slots.

\subsection{Assembler Syntax}
\label{sec:syntax}

Comments in assembler files begin with a sharp-sign ({\tt \#}).
Everything from the sharp-sign to the end of the line is ignored.

Identifiers are a sequence of alphanumeric characters, underbars ({\tt
\_}), and dots ({\tt .}) that do not begin with a number.  Opcodes for
instructions are reserved words that are {\bf not} valid identifiers.
Labels are declared by putting them at the beginning of a line
followed by a colon, for example:
\begin{verbatim}
        .data
  item: .word 1
        .text
        .globl main             # Must be global
  main: lw $t0, item
\end{verbatim}

Strings are enclosed in double-quotes ({\tt "}).  Special characters
in strings follow the C convention:
\begin{verbatim}
    newline        \n
    tab            \t
    quote          \"
\end{verbatim}

SPIM supports a subset of the assembler directives provided by the
MIPS assembler:
\begin{description}
  \item [] {\tt .align n}\newline Align the next datum on a $2^n$ byte
boundary.  For example, {\tt .align 2} aligns the next value on a word
boundary.  {\tt .align 0} turns off automatic alignment of {\tt
.half}, {\tt .word}, {\tt .float}, and {\tt .double} directives until
the next {\tt .data} or {\tt .kdata} directive.

  \item [] {\tt .ascii str}\newline Store the string in memory, but do
not null-terminate it.

  \item [] {\tt .asciiz str}\newline Store the string in memory and
null-terminate it.

  \item [] {\tt .byte b1, ..., bn}\newline Store the $n$ values in
successive bytes of memory.

  \item [] {\tt .data <addr>}\newline The following data items should
be stored in the data segment.  If the optional argument {\em addr\/}
is present, the items are stored beginning at address {\em addr\/}.

  \item [] {\tt .double d1, ..., dn}\newline Store the $n$ floating
point double precision numbers in successive memory locations.

  \item [] {\tt .extern sym size}\newline Declare that the datum
stored at {\tt sym} is {\tt size} bytes large and is a global symbol.
This directive enables the assembler to store the datum in a portion
of the data segment that is efficiently accessed via register {\tt
\$gp}.

  \item [] {\tt .float f1, ..., fn}\newline Store the $n$ floating
point single precision numbers in successive memory locations.

  \item [] {\tt .globl sym}\newline Declare that symbol {\tt sym} is
global and can be referenced from other files.

  \item [] {\tt .half h1, ..., hn}\newline Store the $n$ 16-bit
quantities in successive memory halfwords.

  \item [] {\tt .kdata <addr>}\newline The following data items should
be stored in the kernel data segment. If the optional argument {\em
addr\/} is present, the items are stored beginning at address {\em
addr\/}.

  \item [] {\tt .ktext <addr>}\newline The next items are put in the
kernel text segment.  In SPIM, these items may only be instructions or
words (see the {\tt .word} directive below). If the optional argument
{\em addr\/} is present, the items are stored beginning at address
{\em addr\/}.

  \item [] {\tt .space n}\newline Allocate $n$ bytes of space in the
current segment (which must be the data segment in SPIM).

  \item [] {\tt .text <addr>}\newline The next items are put in the
user text segment.  In SPIM, these items may only be instructions or
words (see the {\tt .word} directive below).  If the optional argument
{\em addr\/} is present, the items are stored beginning at address
{\em addr\/}.

  \item [] {\tt .word w1, ..., wn}\newline Store the $n$ 32-bit
quantities in successive memory words.
\end{description}
SPIM does not distinguish various parts of the data segment ({\tt
.data}, {\tt .rdata}, and {\tt .sdata}).

\subsection{System Calls}
\label{sec:scall}

  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|l|}
    \hline
     \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\bf Service} &

     \hline
      print\_int & 1 & {\tt \$a0} = integer & \\
      print\_float & 2 & {\tt \$f12} = float & \\
      print\_double & 3 & {\tt \$f12} = double & \\
      print\_string & 4 & {\tt \$a0} = string & \\
      read\_int & 5 & & integer (in {\tt \$v0}) \\
      read\_float & 6 & & float (in {\tt \$f0}) \\
      read\_double & 7 & & double (in {\tt \$f0}) \\
      read\_string & 8 & {\tt \$a0} = buffer, {\tt \$a1} = length & \\
      sbrk & 9 & {\tt \$a0} = amount & address (in {\tt \$v0}) \\
      exit & 10 & & \\
      print\_character & 11 & {\tt \$a0} = integer & \\
      read\_character & 12 & char (in {\tt \$v0}) \\
     \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{System services.}
  \label{tab:syscall}
\end{table}
SPIM provides a small set of operating-system-like services through
the system call ({\tt syscall}) instruction.  To request a service, a
program loads the system call code (see Table~\ref{tab:syscall}) into
register {\tt \$v0} and the arguments into registers {\tt
\$a0}$\ldots${\tt \$a3} (or {\tt \$f12} for floating point values).
System calls that return values put their result in register {\tt
\$v0} (or {\tt \$f0} for floating point results).  For example, to
print ``{\tt the answer = 5}'', use the commands:
\begin{verbatim}
        .data
  str:  .asciiz "the answer = "
        .text
        li $v0, 4        # system call code for print_str
        la $a0, str      # address of string to print
        syscall          # print the string

        li $v0, 1        # system call code for print_int
        li $a0, 5        # integer to print
        syscall          # print it
\end{verbatim}

{\tt print\_int} is passed an integer and prints it on the console.
{\tt print\_float} prints a single floating point number. {\tt
print\_double} prints a double precision number.  {\tt print\_string}
is passed a pointer to a null-terminated string, which it writes to
the console.

{\tt read\_int}, {\tt read\_float}, and {\tt read\_double} read an
entire line of input up to and including the newline.  Characters
following the number are ignored.  {\tt read\_string} has the same
semantics as the Unix library routine {\tt fgets}.  It reads up to
$n-1$ characters into a buffer and terminates the string with a null
byte.  If there are fewer characters on the current line, it reads
through the newline and again null-terminates the string.  {\bf
Warning:} programs that use these syscalls to read from the terminal
should not use memory-mapped IO (see Section~\ref{sec:IO}).

{\tt sbrk} returns a pointer to a block of memory containing $n$
additional bytes.  {\tt exit} stops a program from running.

\label{sec:mips}

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\psfig{figure=mips.id,height=4in}}
  \caption{MIPS R2000 CPU and FPU}
  \label{fig:mips}
\end{figure}
A MIPS processor consists of an integer processing unit (the CPU) and
a collection of coprocessors that perform ancillary tasks or operate
on other types of data such as floating point numbers (see
Figure~\ref{fig:mips}).  SPIM simulates two coprocessors.  Coprocessor
0 handles traps, exceptions, and the virtual memory system.  SPIM
simulates most of the first two and entirely omits details of the
memory system.  Coprocessor 1 is the floating point unit.  SPIM
simulates most aspects of this unit.

  \caption{MIPS registers and the convention governing their use.}
  \label{tab:reg}
\end{table}

The MIPS (and SPIM) central processing unit contains 32 general
purpose 32-bit registers that are numbered 0--31.  Register $n$ is designated
by {\tt \$n}.  Register {\tt \$0} always contains the hardwired value
0.  MIPS has established a set of conventions as to how registers
should be used.  These suggestions are guidelines, which are not
enforced by the hardware.  However a program that violates them will
not work properly with other software.  Table~\ref{tab:reg} lists the
registers and describes their intended use.

Registers {\tt \$at} (1), {\tt \$k0} (26), and {\tt \$k1} (27) are
reserved for use by the assembler and operating system.

Registers {\tt \$a0}--{\tt \$a3} (4--7) are used to pass the first
four arguments to routines (remaining arguments are passed on the
stack).  Registers {\tt \$v0} and {\tt \$v1} (2, 3) are used to return
values from functions.  Registers {\tt \$t0}--{\tt \$t9} (8--15, 24,
25) are caller-saved registers used for temporary quantities that do
not need to be preserved across calls.  Registers {\tt \$s0}--{\tt
\$s7} (16--23) are callee-saved registers that hold long-lived values
that should be preserved across calls.

Register {\tt \$sp} (29) is the stack pointer, which points to the last
location in use on the stack.\footnote{In earlier version of SPIM, {\tt
\$sp} was documented as pointing at the first free word on the stack (not
the last word of the stack frame).  Recent MIPS documents have made it clear
that this was an error.  Both conventions work equally well, but we choose
to follow the real system.}  Register {\tt \$fp} (30) is the frame
pointer.\footnote{The MIPS compiler does not use a frame pointer, so this
register is used as callee-saved register {\tt \$s8}.} Register {\tt \$ra}
(31) is written with the return address for a call by the {\tt jal}
instruction.

Register {\tt \$gp} (28) is a global pointer that points into the
middle of a 64K block of memory in the heap that holds constants and
global variables.  The objects in this heap can be quickly accessed
with a single load or store instruction.

In addition, coprocessor 0 contains registers that are useful to
handle exceptions.  SPIM does not implement all of these registers,
since they are not of much use in a simulator or are part of the
memory system, which is not implemented.  However, it does provide the
following:
\begin{center}
  \small
  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|}
    \hline
    {\bf Register Name} & {\bf Number} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\bf Usage} \\
    \hline
    \hline
    BadVAddr & 8 & Memory address at which address exception occurred \\
    Status & 12 & Interrupt mask and enable bits \\
    Cause & 13 & Exception type and pending interrupt bits \\
    EPC & 14 & Address of instruction that caused exception \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
These registers are part of coprocessor 0's register set and are
accessed by the {\tt lwc0}, {\tt mfc0}, {\tt mtc0}, and {\tt swc0}
instructions.

\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:status_reg} describes the bits in the {\tt Status}
register that are implemented by SPIM.  The {\tt interrupt mask}
contains a bit for each of the five interrupt levels.  If a bit is
one, interrupts at that level are allowed.  If the bit is zero,
interrupts at that level are disabled.  The low six bits of the {\tt
Status} register implement a three-level stack for the {\tt
kernel/user} and {\tt interrupt enable} bits.  The {\tt kernel/user}
bit is 0 if the program was running in the kernel when the interrupt
occurred and 1 if it was in user mode. If the {\tt interrupt enable}
bit is 1, interrupts are allowed.  If it is 0, they are disabled. At an
interrupt, these six bits are shifted left by two bits, so the current
bits become the previous bits and the previous bits become the old
bits.  The current bits are both set to 0 (i.e., kernel mode with
interrupts disabled).

Figure~\ref{fig:cause_reg} describes the bits in the {\tt Cause}
registers.  The five {\tt pending interrupt} bits correspond to the
five interrupt levels.  A bit becomes 1 when an interrupt at its level
has occurred but has not been serviced.  The {\tt exception code}
register contains a code from the following table describing the cause
of an exception.
\begin{center}
  \small
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    {\bf Number} & {\bf Name} & {\bf Description} \\
    \hline
    \hline
    0 & INT & External interrupt \\
    4 & ADDRL & Address error exception (load or instruction fetch) \\
    5 & ADDRS & Address error exception (store) \\
    6 & IBUS & Bus error on instruction fetch \\
    7 & DBUS & Bus error on data load or store \\
    8 & SYSCALL & Syscall exception \\
    9 & BKPT & Breakpoint exception \\
    10&  RI & Reserved instruction exception \\
    12&  OVF & Arithmetic overflow exception \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Byte Order}

Processors can number the bytes within a word to make the byte with
the lowest number either the leftmost or rightmost one.  The convention
used by a machine is its {\em byte order\/}.  MIPS processors can
operate with either {\em big-endian\/} byte order:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \multicolumn{4}{c}{{\bf Byte \#}} \\
    \hline
    0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
or {\em little-endian\/} byte order:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \multicolumn{4}{c}{{\bf Byte \#}} \\
    \hline
    3 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
SPIM operates with both byte orders.  SPIM's byte order is determined
by the byte order of the underlying hardware running the simulator.
On a DECstation 3100, SPIM is little-endian, while on a HP Bobcat, Sun
4 or PC/RT, SPIM is big-endian.

\subsection {Addressing Modes}

MIPS is a load/store architecture, which means that only load and
store instructions access memory.  Computation instructions operate
only on values in registers.  The bare machine provides only one
memory addressing mode: {\tt c(rx)}, which uses the sum of the
immediate (integer) {\tt c} and the contents of register {\tt rx} as
the address.  The virtual machine provides the following addressing
modes for load and store instructions:
\begin{center}
  \small
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\bf Format} &
	\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\bf Address Computation} \\
    \hline
    \hline
    (register) &  contents of register \\
    imm & immediate \\
    imm (register) & immediate + contents of register \\
    symbol & address of symbol \\
    symbol $\pm$ imm & address of symbol $+$ or $-$ immediate \\
    symbol $\pm$ imm (register) & address of symbol $+$ or $-$
	(immediate + contents of register) \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Most load and store instructions operate only on aligned data.  A
quantity is {\em aligned\/} if its memory address is a multiple of its
size in bytes.  Therefore, a halfword object must be stored at even
addresses and a full word object must be stored at addresses that are
a multiple of 4.  However, MIPS provides some instructions for
manipulating unaligned data.

\subsection {Arithmetic and Logical Instructions}

register {\tt CPdest}.


\subsection{Floating Point Instructions}

The MIPS has a floating point coprocessor (numbered 1) that operates
on single precision (32-bit) and double precision (64-bit) floating
point numbers.  This coprocessor has its own registers, which are
numbered {\tt \$f0}--{\tt \$f31}.  Because these registers are only
32-bits wide, two of them are required to hold doubles. To simplify
matters, floating point operations only use even-numbered
registers---including instructions that operate on single floats.

Values are moved in or out of these registers a word (32-bits) at a
time by {\tt lwc1}, {\tt swc1}, {\tt mtc1}, and {\tt mfc1}
instructions described above or by the {\tt l.s}, {\tt l.d}, {\tt
s.s}, and {\tt s.d} pseudoinstructions described below.  The flag set
by floating point comparison operations is read by the CPU with its
{\tt bc1t} and {\tt bc1f} instructions.

In all instructions below, {\tt FRdest}, {\tt FRsrc1}, {\tt FRsrc2},

\section{Memory Usage}

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\psfig{figure=mem.id,height=4in}}
  \caption{Layout of memory.}
  \label{fig:mem}
\end{figure}
The organization of memory in MIPS systems is conventional.  A
program's address space is composed of three parts (see
Figure~\ref{fig:mem}).

At the bottom of the user address space (0x400000) is the text
segment, which holds the instructions for a program.

Above the text segment is the data segment (starting at 0x10000000),
which is divided into two parts.  The static data portion contains
objects whose size and address are known to the compiler and linker.
Immediately above these objects is dynamic data.  As a program
allocates space dynamically (i.e., by {\tt malloc}), the {\tt sbrk}
system call moves the top of the data segment up.

The program stack resides at the top of the address space
(0x7fffffff).  It grows down, towards the data segment.

\section{Calling Convention}

The calling convention described in this section is the one used by
{\em gcc\/}, not the native MIPS compiler, which uses a more complex
convention that is slightly faster.

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\psfig{figure=stack-frame.id,height=4in}}
  \caption{Layout of a stack frame.  The frame pointer points just
below the last argument passed on the stack.  The stack pointer points
to the last word in the frame.}
  \label{fig:stack}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:stack} shows a diagram of a stack frame.  A frame
consists of the memory between the frame pointer ({\tt \$fp}), which
points to the word immediately after the last argument passed on the
stack, and the stack pointer ({\tt \$sp}), which points to the last
word in the frame.  As typical of Unix systems, the stack grows
down from higher memory addresses, so the frame pointer is above stack
pointer.

The following steps are necessary to effect a call:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Pass the arguments.  By convention, the first four arguments
are passed in registers {\tt \$a0}--{\tt \$a3} (though simpler
compilers may choose to ignore this convention and pass all arguments
via the stack).  The remaining arguments are pushed on the stack.

  \item Save the caller-saved registers.  This includes registers {\tt
\$t0}--{\tt \$t9}, if they contain live values at the call site.

  \item Execute a {\tt jal} instruction.
\end{enumerate}

Within the called routine, the following steps are necessary:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Establish the stack frame by subtracting the frame size from
the stack pointer.

  \item Save the callee-saved registers in the frame.  Register {\tt
\$fp} is always saved.  Register {\tt \$ra} needs to be saved if the
routine itself makes calls.  Any of the registers {\tt \$s0}--{\tt
\$s7} that are used by the callee need to be saved.

  \item Establish the frame pointer by adding the stack frame size - 4
to the address in {\tt \$sp}.
\end{enumerate}

Finally, to return from a call, a function places the returned value
into {\tt \$v0} and executes the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Restore any callee-saved registers that were saved upon entry
(including the frame pointer {\tt \$fp}).

  \item Pop the stack frame by adding the frame size to {\tt \$sp}.

  \item Return by jumping to the address in register {\tt \$ra}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Input and Output}
\label{sec:IO}

In addition to simulating the basic operation of the CPU and operating
system, SPIM also simulates a memory-mapped terminal connected to the
machine.  When a program is ``running,'' SPIM connects its own
terminal (or a separate console window in {\tt xspim}) to the
processor.  The program can read characters that you type while the
processor is running.  Similarly, if SPIM executes instructions to
write characters to the terminal, the characters will appear on SPIM's
terminal or console window.  One exception to this rule is control-C:
it is not passed to the processor, but instead causes SPIM to stop
simulating and return to command mode.  When the processor stops
executing (for example, because you typed control-C or because the
machine hit a breakpoint), the terminal is reconnected to SPIM so you
can type SPIM commands.  To use memory-mapped IO, {\tt spim} or {\tt
xspim} must be started with the {\tt -mapped\_io} flag.

The terminal device consists of two independent units: a {\em
receiver\/} and a {\em transmitter\/}.  The receiver unit reads
characters from the keyboard as they are typed.  The transmitter unit
writes characters to the terminal's display.  The two units are
completely independent.  This means, for example, that characters
typed at the keyboard are not automatically ``echoed'' on the display.
Instead, the processor must get an input character from the receiver
and re-transmit it to echo it.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{The terminal is controlled by four device registers,
each of which appears as a special memory location at the given
address.  Only a few bits of the registers are actually used: the
others always read as zeroes and are ignored on writes.}
  \label{fig:io_reg}
\end{figure}

The processor accesses the terminal using four memory-mapped device
registers, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:io_reg}.  ``Memory-mapped''
means that each register appears as a special memory location.  The
Receiver Control Register is at location 0xffff0000; only two of its
bits are actually used.  Bit 0 is called ``ready'': if it is one it
means that a character has arrived from the keyboard but has not yet
been read from the receiver data register.  The ready bit is
read-only: attempts to write it are ignored.  The ready bit changes
automatically from zero to one when a character is typed at the
keyboard, and it changes automatically from one to zero when the
character is read from the receiver data register.

Bit one of the Receiver Control Register is ``interrupt enable''.
This bit may be both read and written by the processor.  The interrupt
enable is initially zero.  If it is set to one by the processor, an
interrupt is requested by the terminal on level zero whenever the
ready bit is one.  For the interrupt actually to be received by the
processor, interrupts must be enabled in the status register of the
system coprocessor (see Section \ref{sec:mips}).

Other bits of the Receiver Control Register are unused: they always
read as zeroes and are ignored in writes.

The second terminal device register is the Receiver Data Register (at
address 0xffff0004).  The low-order eight bits of this register
contain the last character typed on the keyboard, and all the other
bits contain zeroes.  This register is read-only and only changes
value when a new character is typed on the keyboard.  Reading the
Receiver Data Register causes the ready bit in the Receiver Control
Register to be reset to zero.

The third terminal device register is the Transmitter Control Register
(at address 0xffff0008).  Only the low-order two bits of this register
are used, and they behave much like the corresponding bits of the
Receiver Control Register.  Bit 0 is called ``ready'' and is
read-only.  If it is one it means the transmitter is ready to accept a
new character for output.  If it is zero it means the transmitter is
still busy outputting the previous character given to it.  Bit one is
``interrupt enable''; it is readable and writable.  If it is set to
one, then an interrupt will be requested on level one whenever the
ready bit is one.

The final device register is the Transmitter Data Register (at address
0xffff000c).  When it is written, the low-order eight bits are taken
as an ASCII character to output to the display.  When the Transmitter
Data Register is written, the ready bit in the Transmitter Control
Register will be reset to zero.  The bit will stay zero until enough
time has elapsed to transmit the character to the terminal; then the
ready bit will be set back to one again.  The Transmitter Data
Register should only be written when the ready bit of the Transmitter
Control Register is one; if the transmitter isn't ready then writes to
the Transmitter Data Register are ignored (the write appears to
succeed but the character will not be output).

In real computers it takes time to send characters over the serial
lines that connect terminals to computers.  These time lags are
simulated by SPIM.  For example, after the transmitter starts
transmitting a character, the transmitter's ready bit will become zero
for a while.  SPIM measures this time in instructions executed, not in
real clock time.  This means that the transmitter will not become
ready again until the processor has executed a certain number of
instructions.  If you stop the machine and look at the ready bit using
SPIM, it will not change.  However, if you let the machine run then
the bit will eventually change back to one.
