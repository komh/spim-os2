There also exists a port of SPIM to the Amiga.  I haven't tried it, but the
diff's are in Documentation/Amiga_Patches and the compiled files are also
available:

  Hello.

  I did a port of your SPIM, and I have uploaded a source distribution
  and a binary distribution at ftp.funet.fi (pub/amiga/apps/emulations):

  -rw-r--r--   1 10000    20        420185  Mar 10 16:24 amiSPIM-bin.lha
  -rw-r--r--   1 10000    20        450614  Mar 10 16:25 amiSPIM-src.lha
  -rw-r--r--   1 10000    20          1045  Mar 10 16:25 amiSPIM.readme

  The binary distribution does not have the Documentation and the Tests,
  but includes binaries for spim and xspim.

  I've sent you the diffs necessary to compile SPIM before, and the
  source distribution is nothing more than these diffs applied to the
  original source tree.
