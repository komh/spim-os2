	* mips-syscall.c cl-cache.c cl-cycle.c cl-except.c cl-cache.h
	cl-expect.h
	Change from Scott Rosenberg:

there were some problems with the signal handling because somehow an
old (and incorrect version) of gun's signal stuff was merged with mine.
fixes to both cl-spim and spim code can be found in cl-except.[ch] and
mips-syscall.c.  the errors came about due to incorrect management of
spim's pseudo memory which resulted in seg violations.

i also fixed a one line problem in mips-syscall.c in old spim code so
that return values on exit when running an assembly file in cycle mode
would match values expected by cl-spim.  (i hadn't tested this until
someone sent me mail).

i updated cl-cache.[ch] so that it could print the write back buffer.
